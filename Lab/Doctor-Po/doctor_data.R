set.seed(20200403)

# 100,000 people with differing levels of covid symptoms
N_people = 100000
df = data.table(person = 1:N_people)

# Potential outcomes (Y0): life-span if no vent
df[, y0 := rnorm(N_people, 9.4, 4)]
df[y0 < 0, y0 := 0]

# Potential outcomes (Y1): life-span if assigned to vents
df[, y1 := rnorm(N_people, 10, 4)]
df[y1 < 0, y1 := 0]

# Define individual treatment effect


# Perfect doctor assigns vents (the treatment) only to those who benefit


# Calculate all aggregate Causal Parameters (ATE, ATT, ATU)

# Use the switching equation to select realized outcomes from potential outcomes based on treatment assignment given by the Perfect Doctor


# Calculate EY0 for vent group and no vent group so we can calculate selection bias


# Calculate selection bias based on the previous conditional expectations


# Calculate the share of units treated with vents (pi)


# Manually calculate the simple difference in mean health outcomes between the vent and non-vent group


# Calculate the simple difference in mean health outcomes between the vent and non-vent group using an OLS specification


# Fill out table with all this information


# Were you able to estimate the ATE, ATT or the ATU using the SDO?  Why/why not?
